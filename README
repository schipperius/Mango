The Book of Jack - by Mark Schipper

The Book of Jack was supposed to be an entertaining exploration of the name 'Jack', its origins and usage, the letter 'j' and even the sound 'dzh', but it turned into something quite a bit different...

... I thought about putting the book on the Internet and that led me to the art and science of Web design and development, which in turn, led me to Ruby on Rails.
